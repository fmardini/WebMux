 * Get rid of compiler warnings
 * Two hash tables one from connfd to muxConn the other from user_id to list of connfds
 * Proper error handling (propagate errors and close connection)
 * Add testing
 * Active connection sensing: only send updates to the connection from which we are receiving (case of multiple connections)
 * Revisit used hash table library
